# complex_langevin_py
Implementation of the Complex Langevin Method in Python (GPU accelerated)   
   
## Currently working:   
Perform complex langevin on 1-component complex nonrelativistic scalar field      
Arbitrary spatial dimension   
Arbitrary lattice sizes   
Extract total particle number and momentum spectrum as observables   
CUDA acceleration   
   
## TODO:  
Add more Observables, especially arbitrary n-point functions   
Add multi-component support   
(Maybe) refactor to OOP   
Improve GPU acceleration with costum CUDA kernels (already pretty good tho)
