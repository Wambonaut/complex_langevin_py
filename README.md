# complex_langevin_py
Implementation of the Complex Langevin Method in Python (GPU accelerated)   
   
## Currently working:   
Perform complex langevin on multi-component complex nonrelativistic scalar field      
Arbitrary spatial dimension   
Arbitrary lattice sizes   
Observables: particle number, momentum spectrum, dispersion    
CUDA acceleration   
Spin-1 Spin-Spin and quadratic Zeeman Interaction
Mean field calculations in easy plane phase
Quasiparticle dispersion for easy plane gapless mode
Automatic processing of parameter files for use in slurm jobs
